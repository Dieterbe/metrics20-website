Hi,
as from now, [metrics20.org](http://metrics20.org) features a news section,
which will be useful to keep you up to date on any noteworthy changes.
(also available as [rss feed](http://metrics20.org/news/index.xml)).  

Furthermore, I'm trying to make the development of the spec more democratic and transparent.
The spec now lives in its [own repository](https://github.com/metrics20/spec) in the metrics20 group on github and is tagged as [v1.0](https://github.com/metrics20/spec/releases/tag/v1.0) which will form the baseline of further work.  
Hopefully more people will get involved and we can adopt some kind of democratic model. For now it's a benevolent dictatorship :)
If you have any suggestions about how to manage or improve metrics 2.0, please let them know via the [google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/metrics20) or submit a pull request.

Finally, as I got to [present metrics2.0 at monitorama this year](http://dieter.plaetinck.be/monitorama-pdx-metrics20.html) I added the slides and video to the [media](/media/) page.  I believe this presentation is a good introduction to the problems with metrics, the concepts and solutions via metrics 2.0, and also introduces a bunch of practical benefits via [Graph-Explorer](http://vimeo.github.io/graph-explorer/) and some ideas I posed for future work.
